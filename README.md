# super-sudo-helper
A C++ project (in progress) that helps (not solves!) when solving Sudoku puzzles.

This is me showing you how I progress through my Object Oriented Programming Practices class. Subsequent projects are built on their predecessors (i.e. p2 would be an improvement on p1).

The end goal is to have something that one can use to organize their life when solving a sudoku puzzle (less mental work, and no more erasing your previous solutions, YAY!)

This is/was an in-class project, and some code stubs and files were supplied by my professor (Alice E. Fischer).
